# 🐍 CS50P Practice – My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my **CS50P practice repository**, where I document my journey learning Python through Harvard’s *CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python*.  
This repo contains my personal practice programs, experiments, and notes to strengthen my understanding of Python.

> 🛑 **Note:** All official CS50P problem set solutions are **excluded** from this repository and are listed in `.gitignore` to follow the course’s academic honesty policy.

## 📘 About
The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice Python concepts in small, manageable programs  
- Reinforce problem-solving and logical thinking  
- Track my growth and learning progress over time  
- Build a clean, well-organized repository that showcases my learning journey

├── 01_basics/ # Basics like hello world and simple programs
│ ├── hello.py
│ ├── calculator.py
├── 02_conditionals/ # Programs using if/else, boolean logic
│ ├── parity.py
│ ├── grading.py
├── 03_loops/ # Loops and iterations
│ ├── mario.py

└── .gitignore




- Each folder represents a **topic or week** from the course  
- `experiments/` contains small personal projects and code explorations  
- `.gitignore` ensures sensitive or graded content (like `problem_sets/`) is never tracked

## 🧰 Tools & Environment
- **Python 3.11+** – main programming language  
- **Visual Studio Code** – code editor  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control  
- **Virtual environments** – optional for experimenting with packages

---

## 💬 Learning Notes
- Every program in this repo is a small, self-contained practice snippet  
- Encourage others taking CS50P to **write their own solutions** — this is the best way to learn  
- Code is structured to make it easy to revisit and understand later
